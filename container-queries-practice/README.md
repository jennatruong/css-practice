Web Dev Simplified Video on Youtube: Responsive CSS Will Never Be The Same

This is IN PROGRESS - only got the two files created, but a couple of the stylesheets used in the video no longer seem to be working so hard to replicate currently. Putting this on hold and practicing other css skills for a while. Can come back to this in the future. 

@media media querie might also not be working quite right?
